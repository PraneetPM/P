Hydrodynamic Prediction using Machine Learning in Slurry Bubble Columns

This repository contains Python scripts, supporting datasets, and graphical user interfaces (GUIs) developed for predicting key **hydrodynamic parameters** in **slurry bubble column reactors (SBCs)**, namely:

- **Gas holdup (Œ±g)**
- **Mass transfer coefficient (kLa)**
- **Bubble rise velocity (Ub)**
- **Bubble size (db)**

The models are trained and validated using both **literature data** and **experimental measurements**, offering insights into how different parameters influence reactor-scale hydrodynamics.

Model Overview

Each parameter module includes:
- A **Python script** for training and testing ML models  
- A **dataset (.xlsx)** for input-output variables  
- Optionally, a **Tkinter GUI** for real-time predictions  
- Scripts for **visualization** (parity plots, feature importance, SHAP values)  

The machine learning models rely on **dimensionless correlations** (Reynolds, Froude, Weber, E√∂tv√∂s numbers, etc.) to ensure generalization across systems and scales.
